    "# Raspberry Pi direct interface to Karpova Nosepoke\n",
    "## Materials\n",
    "- [Karpova Nosepoke](https://karpova-lab.github.io/nosepoke/)\n",
    "- Ethernet cable with RJ45 connectors.\n",
    "- Raspberry pi\n",
    "- DuPont-type connector kit (or similar clone). Female if plugging straight into the raspberry pi. Male if plugging into breakout breadboard\n",
    "- DuPont-type connector crimp tool\n",
    "- Wire stripper/cutter\n",
    "- Super glue\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembly\n",
    "- Cut off one of the RJ45 connectors from the ethernet cable\n",
    "- Strip the cable jacket to expose roughly 5cm of the inner wires\n",
    "- Tape wires 4,5, and 8 (solid blue, striped green, brown) to the cable jacket so they are out of the way\n",
    "- Strip ~2mm of insulation from wires 1,2,3,6,7 (striped orange, solid orange, striped green, solid green, striped brown). Add dupont connectors to wires 1,3,6 \n",
    "- Wires 2 and 7 will go to ground, so bundle the two together, and apply a dupont connector to the bundled wires. This is the **ground bundle**\n",
    "- In a jacket for two connectors, place the connector for wire 6, and the connector containing the ground bundle. This connector pair will go to the 5V output pin and ground pins. \n",
    "- Wires 1 and 3 will plug into GPIO. You can jacket them as a pair, or independently depending on your layout needs. **This example assumes wire 1 is plugged into raspberry pi board pin 23, and wire 3 is plugged into pin 22**\n",
